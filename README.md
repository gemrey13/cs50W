# CS50W: Web Programming with Django and JavaScript

Welcome to my CS50W repository! This is a collection of projects and assignments from Harvard's Web Programming with Django and JavaScript course. 
As a student, I am learning the fundamentals of web development with an emphasis on full-stack development using the Django web framework and modern front-end libraries such as React.

- Lecture 0: HMTL and CSS
- Lecture 1: Git
- Lecture 2: Python
- Lecture 3: Django
- Lecture 4: SQL, Models, and Migrations
- Lecture 5: Javascript
- Lecture 6: User Interface
- Lecture 7: Testing and CI/CD
- Lecture 8: Scalability and Secuirity


Each project has its own folder containing the source code, templates, and relevant documentation. 
Additionally, I have included my notes, exercises, and solutions from the lectures and problem sets.

I hope that this repository can serve as a helpful resource for fellow students, aspiring web developers, and anyone interested in learning about web development. Feel free to explore the projects and leave feedback. Happy coding!
