# Javascript  

 
 Javascript is used by programmers across the world to create dynamic and interactive web content like applications and browsers. JavaScript is so popular that it's the most used programming language in the world, used as a client-side programming language by 97.0% of all websites.

JavaScript is commonly used to make web pages dynamic. As a client scripting language, it provides websites with interactivity like prompts and alerts and it can add animations to images and text. BairesDev's development of web apps for MTV provides a good example of JavaScript being used in web development.


js makes responsive design easier. JavaScript has become integral to the Internet experience as developers build increased interaction and complexity into their applications. Search engines, ecommerce, content management systems, responsive design, social media and phone apps would not be possible without it.
